	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><b>Why ConnectingU?</b>
	<br>
	There are many IT service providers, and they focus on being the lowest cost provider in the area.
	Sure, they are cheap, but you get what you pay for.  Furthermore, due to the recent relevations about industry and government wide cyber attacks, the US government has amplified DFARS to include criminal and civil penalties, lauched the CMMC which is enforced by auditors and is required for DOD RFIs, and made NIST a part of HITRUST.  These regulations will spread to the rest of the federal government and even states. Don't the cheapest service in town lead to losing out on compliance and therefore contracts.</p1>

	<br>
	<p1><b>Why does this matter to your business?</b>
	<br>
	A business does not have to directly do business with the federal government to be impacted by revised information security regulations.  If your business touches health care, public and private education from daycare through universities, research that could have military or space applications, you want to be aware of changes in regulations. If your business has any impact on the national infrastructure pillars of defense, finance, infrastructure or healthcare, you should expect added requirements.  You ask "what kind of requirements?", great question!  Well being banned from using any business service or device with a brand name from certain countries is one new restriction.  If your company has a home office in another country, their access to the business network in the US could be more limited.</p1>
