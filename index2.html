	<p1><b>What is cloud computing?</b>
	<br>
	Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers.
	Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.</p1>

	<br>
	<p1><b>Why does this matter to your business?</b>
	<br>
	Cloud technology has long been focused on access and low cost, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  After years of data theft, especially of financial data and personally identifiable information (PII), as well as attackers using the hosting platforms of SMEs to launch a variety of cyber attacks, the US government is raising the bar for security on websites.  PCI will become the most stringent, and HIPAA may see more enforcement, even if it is through HITRUST.  Above these all is the CMMC, which right now is being applied to the US Department of Defense and Department Homeland Security, but will soon cover all national clould compliance standards.  The US government, as well as the national insurance industry, are working together to mandate and enforce far more stringent clould security compliance.

	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><b>What does "I am HIPAA/HITRUST compliant" mean?</b>
	<br>
	</li>In addition to security measures for on-premises applications, organizations must also consider how their use of cloud services impacts their HIPAA and HITECH obligations. There are several steps organizations can take to secure PHI data in the cloud:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A cloud service that stores or transmits PHI qualifies as a business associate, and, therefore, its security controls should be audited before uploading PHI</li>
			<li>Breach notification is not required in cases where data has been made inaccessible via encryption. Maintain control of encryption keys to remove this obligation.</li>
			<li>Inspect content uploaded to the cloud, and revoke sharing permissions to stop the disclosure of PHI to outside parties that should not have access.</li>
			<li>Detect and stop PHI from being uploaded to unsecure or unsanctioned cloud services.</li>
			<li>Enforce access control policies for cloud services to ensure that only devices approved by your organization have access to sensitive data.</li>
			<li>Many cloud services lack secure password capabilities. Enforce strong password policies using single sign-on solutions and multifactor authentication.</li>
			<li>Capture audit trails of every user action, including user, date and time, result, and affected resource name using a third-party auditing tool, if not natively available.</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<p1><b>What does "I am PCI-DSS compliant" mean?</b>
	<br>
	Use of a PCI DSS compliant Cloud Service Provider (CSP) does not result in PCI DSS compliance for the clients.The client must still ensure they are using the service in a compliant manner, and is also ultimately responsible for the security of their CHD—outsourcing daily management of a subset of PCI DSS requirements does not remove the client’s responsibility to ensure Confidential Health Data   (CHD) is properly secured and that PCI DSS controls are met.</p1>
	<br>
	<p1>
	The client therefore must work with the CSP to ensure that evidence is provided to verify that PCI DSS controls are maintained on an ongoing basis—an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) reflects a single point in time only; compliance requires ongoing monitoring and validation that controls are in place and working effectively.Even where a cloud service is validated for certain PCI DSS requirements, this validation does not automatically transfer to the client environmentswithin that cloud service.For example, a CSP’s validation may have included use of up-to-date anti-virus software on the CSP’s systems; however, this validation mightnot extend to the individual client OS or Virtual Machines (VMs) (such as in an IaaS service).Additionally, the client must still maintain compliance for all of their own operations—for example, by ensuring anti-virus is installed and updated on all client-side systems used to connect into the cloud environment.</p1>
	<br>
	<p1>
	Similarly, a client’s PCI DSS compliance does not result in any claim of compliance for the CSP, even if the client’s validation included elements of the service managed by the CSP.</p1>
	<li>Regarding the applicability of one party’s compliance to the other, consider the following:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If a CSP is compliant, this does not mean that their clients are.</li>
			<li>If a CSP’s clients are compliant, this does not mean that the CSP is.</li>
			<li>If a CSP and the client are compliant, this does not mean that any other clients are.</li>
		</ul>
	<p1>The CSP should ensure that any service offered as being “PCI compliant” is accompanied by a clear and unambiguous explanation, supported by appropriate evidence,of which aspects of the service have been validated as compliant and which have not.</p1>
